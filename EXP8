AIM:
         To draw the diagrams [ Usecase, Class, Activity, Sequence, Collaboration, State chart, Deployment, Component, package] for software personnel management system.
SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION:
SL.NO	SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION
1.0	Hardware Requirements
1.1	Software Requirements
1.2	Project description
1.3	Reference

1.0 HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:
         Intel Pentium Processor I3/I5
1.1 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
         Rational Rose/Argo UML
1.2 PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
          This software is designed for the process of knowing the details of a person works in a software company.  The details are being stored in the Central Management System for the cross checking the person’s details.

	Public void leave taken()
	{
	}
	Public void employee()
	{
	}
}

HUMAN RESOURCES:
